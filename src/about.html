    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        Created by Emmy Award-winning producer Dick Wolf, "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit," now in its 16th season,
        is
        the longest-running primetime drama currently on television. This hard-hitting and emotional series from NBC's
        "Law
        & Order" brand chronicles the life and crimes of the Special Victims Unit of the New York City Police
        Department, an
        elite squad of detectives who investigate sexually based crimes.<br/><br/>

        As acting Commander of the SVU, Sergeant Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) is a seasoned veteran of the unit who
        has
        seen it all. She leads with empathy and professionalism, all the while dealing with her difficult past - as a
        product of rape and a witness to her mother's grief, she can personally relate to each victim she tries to
        help.<br/><br/>

        Hargitay has garnered eight Emmy nominations for Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Olivia Benson,
        and
        won the 2006 Emmy for that category. She has received six SAG nominations for Outstanding Performance by a
        Female
        Actor in a Drama Series, two Golden Globe nominations for Lead Actress in a Drama Series, winning the award in
        2005,
        and has won three Gracie Allen Awards for Outstanding Female Lead in 2004, 2009 and 2014. In 2013, she was
        honored
        with a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame.<br/><br/>

        Detective Odafin "Fin" Tutuola (Ice T) adds a unique sense of humor and undercover investigative experience,
        making
        him a formidable match for any partner. Detectives Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) and Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish)
        have
        earned their place as top-notch SVU detectives and bring their own talents and style of investigation, while
        facing
        head-on the emotional toll it takes to work the SVU. Pino was nominated in 2013 and 2014 for the Imagen Award
        for
        his role as Nick Amaro, and was nominated for the ALMA Award for Favorite TV Actor in 2012. Assistant District
        Attorney Rafael Barba (Ra√∫l Esparza) seeks justice for SVU's victims and survivors with precision and a passion
        to
        win.<br/><br/>

        "SVU" has been frequently acknowledged for its guest players, with Emmy wins for Outstanding Guest Actress in a
        Drama Series for Ann-Margret (2010), Ellen Burstyn (2009), Cynthia Nixon (2008), Leslie Caron (2007) and Amanda
        Plummer (2005), and nominations for such renowned talent as Brenda Blethyn, Carol Burnett, Robin Williams,
        Marcia
        Gay Harden, Angela Lansbury, Marlee Matlin, Mare Winningham, Barbara Barrie, Martha Plimpton, Jane Alexander and
        Tracy Pollan.<br/><br/>

        In 2012, the NAACP Image Awards honored "SVU" as the year's Outstanding Drama Series, with Ice T and guest
        actress
        Anika Noni Rose nominated in the acting categories. In 2010, guest star Delroy Lindo won the Image Award for
        Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Three "SVU" episodes have been nominated by the GLAAD Media
        Awards
        for outstanding representation of the LGBT community, and SVU was honored with two wins and ten Edgar Allan Poe
        award nominations for Best Television Episode. In addition, the show has garnered several People's Choice Award
        nominations, including Favorite Dramatic TV Actress (Hargitay), Favorite TV Drama, Favorite Scene Stealing Star
        (Richard Belzer, guest star Luke Perry, and winning guest star Robin Williams), and Favorite TV Crime Fighter
        (Hargitay).<br/><br/>
