            <h2>December Solstice</h2>

            <p>
                After last week's shocking discovery about baby Noah's paternity, Benson asks Barba over to her
                apartment
                for an off-the-book discussion. Hypothetically speaking, if Johnny D. fathered a child with Ellie
                Porter, is
                that something that NYPD would have to disclose? Benson, who's already started the adoption paperwork
                for
                Noah, is terrified to lose her baby boy to a sex-trafficking monster. Barba assures Olivia that Johnny
                D.
                doesn't have to know, and the worried mother breathes a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>

                Back at the station, Benson has two visitors: Delilah and Judith Briggs, the daughters of the literary
                icon
                Walter Briggs. They're worried about their elderly father, whose much younger sixth wife, Charmaine,
                pumps
                him full of erectile dysfunction pills and makes him have sex every day. Delilah and Judith are not only
                concerned about their father's safety, considering he has a heart condition, but they consider what
                Charmaine is doing to be rape, as Walter has dementia and cannot consent to sex. They believe their
                stepmother wants to have a child, and thus a larger share of his estate when he passes, but they can't
                stop
                her because Charmaine won't let them near Walter.<br/><br/>

                Rollins and Carisi stop by the Briggs home to do a welfare check, but when they try to speak to Walter
                alone, Charmaine refuses to let him out of her sight. Walt claims he's happy to keep his wife satisfied
                -
                it's his manly duty as her husband. It seems as if Walt isn't complaining, although he does appear
                confused
                and loses his train of thought easily. The next day, the detectives get word that Walt had a heart
                attack
                and is in the hospital. Rollins and Amaro visit Delilah at the off-Broadway theater she runs, and learn
                Charmaine is once again refusing to let Walt's daughters see him, despite a court order. Meanwhile, when
                Benson and Carisi go to see Walt, they learn Charmaine has removed him from the hospital against medical
                advice. Charmaine claimed she was transferring Walt to another hospital, but there's no sign of him
                anywhere. Walt and Charmaine are officially missing.<br/><br/>

                Luckily, Rollins has a lead on Walt's location. A private ambulance driver tells her he got a call to
                pick
                up Briggs and his "crazy wife," but instead of taking them to another hospital, Charmaine told him to go
                to
                a private airport in Westchester. Apparently they were taking a trip to Canada. The driver refused, so
                Charmaine made him stop the car in the middle of 57th Street, where she dragged the old man into a cab.
                SVU
                catches up with the couple at the Westchester airport, and instead of a trip to Canada, they get another
                trip to the courthouse. After what Charmaine put Walt through, Delilah and Judith demand to be appointed
                Walt's guardians. The judge asks Walt if his wife is taking care of him, to which he responds that she
                is.
                However, after further questioning, it's clear Walt has very little idea of where he is, let alone what
                his
                daughters' names are. The judge refuses to determine guardianship until Walt has a psychological and
                physical examination, so she sends him back into the hospital, with visitation rights for his
                daughters.<br/><br/>

                The next morning, SVU gets some unfortunate news. Briggs had another heart attack and died, and since
                the
                judge put off ruling on guardianship, his wife still has control over his estate - and his body. Amaro
                and
                Carisi get a court order and stop Charmaine from taking his body on another hide-and-seek trip. Upon
                examination, the coroner discovers Charmaine made one last attempt to have a child with Walter before he
                died by calling a specialized company to extract his sperm an hour before he died. With this latest
                information, on top of the blue pills and flight from the hospital, Barba is finally on board with the
                theory that Charmaine killed her husband, and is prepared to take the case to trial.<br/><br/>

                But just a day or so into the trail, Delilah, Judith and Charmaine receive a video message from Walter.
                In
                it, he thanks Charmaine for saving his life and accuses his ex-wives of turning his daughters against
                her.
                He tells Delilah that he stopped wanting to see her after she wrote a terrible stage adaptation of one
                of
                his books and wouldn't stop pestering him for the rights to it. He says Charmaine actually fought him on
                it,
                saying a father should see his children, but he refused. When Charmaine takes the stand, she explains
                herself further. Walter knew he was dying, and he wanted to die in peace. She crushed up blue pills in
                his
                food because he was proud and didn't need to know a drug was helping him perform. She wanted to have his
                child because she loved her husband.<br/><br/>

                After seeing the video, Judith confronts her sister, furious that she lied to her about Charmaine hating
                them and refusing to let them visit. In fact, Delilah was the reason Walter didn't want to associate
                with
                his children. She was more interested in her bad play than her father's love. Judith wants to take the
                stand
                for the defense, but instead, the two sides come to an agreement. Charmaine pleads guilty to criminally
                negligent homicide, and agrees to one year's probation on the condition Delilah doesn't put on the play.
                While Charmaine will be cut out of the estate, her unborn child still controls one third. A fertility
                clinic
                implanted a surrogate with her and Walter's child.<br/><br/>

                Meanwhile, Barba is dealing with family drama of his own. His abuelita is old and sick, and his mother
                is
                struggling to take care of her. Barba tries to convince his mother to put abuelita in a retirement home,
                but
                she refuses. They go check out a place, but his grandmother hates it - she wants to stay in her
                sixth-floor
                walk-up. Barba finally has to force her into a home against her wishes. Unfortunately, before he can,
                his
                abuelita is found dead in her apartment. She did always say she wanted to die in her own home.

            <h2>December Solstice</h2>

            <p>
                The SVU team sits in surveillance vans, staking out a downtown brothel, while Carisi poses as a john
                inside.
                He's been waiting for his date for a while, but one of the madams, Martha, assures him a delivery of
                young
                girls is on the way. Just then a minivan arrives and scantily clad girls climb out, led by a woman SVU
                knows
                well: Selena Cruz, the trafficker Benson reunited with her son in the Season 16 premiere. Looks like
                she's
                back to her old tricks...<br/><br/>

                SVU busts the brothel, including Selena, Carisi and Martha, taking everyone into the station. Martha
                pulls
                Benson aside and tells her she's undercover - she's not with any agency, but the ring has her daughter
                Ariel, who was kidnapped three years ago. Benson is skeptical, so Martha takes her to her apartment,
                where
                the walls are covered in a compilation of photos, newspaper clippings, maps and scrawls detailing
                Martha's
                hunt for her missing daughter. Ariel was supposed to be in the delivery of girls that night, but Ariel's
                pimp, Timmer, held back two girls for disciplining. Despite Martha's story, Barba still wants to
                prosecute
                her. Martha pleads with Barba that she's not a criminal. She's personally bought and sent home half a
                dozen
                girls saving them from the sex trade. She was going to buy Ariel that night. Benson and Barba promise
                they'll do their best to find Ariel, but they're going to need Martha's cooperation.<br/><br/>

                The detectives try to get the other prostitutes to give them info on Ariel, but nobody will talk,
                including
                Selena - not even when Amaro informs her Child Services took her son. Later, Selena has a change of
                heart
                and wants to see her son again. She gives SVU the address of a party house in Queens, which Martha
                recognizes. She knows the madam, Tracy. SVU stakes out the place and sees Timmer bringing in three
                girls,
                but no Ariel. When Timmer leaves, the detectives spot a beer delivery truck and bust the driver, Tommy,
                for
                illegal distribution of alcohol to a residence.<br/><br/>

                Super Bowl Sunday is the next day, and there's sure to be a big party at the Queens house. Tommy informs
                them it's a high-class event featuring the best girls and the richest clients. The detectives decide to
                take
                advantage of this, putting surveillance on the house while Amaro takes Tommy's truck and poses as the
                beer
                delivery guy. As soon as he's inside, the rest of the team bursts in and takes over the house. Benson
                explains to Tracy that she needs to go along with the party as planned, and when SVU makes the bust,
                she'll
                have to pretend she's busted, too - and she better make it look good. Benson then shows Tracy Ariel's
                photo
                and demands she make a special request for her. Looks like the detectives are going
                undercover...<br/><br/>

                The next day, the party goes on as scheduled, with Benson decked out in her finest madam-wear, posing as
                Tracy's sister-in-law, Carisi playing a rich john and Fin as a pimp. From the surveillance van outside,
                Martha is starting to worry - she doesn't see Ariel anywhere. Inside, Carisi starts to get agitated -
                where's his sexy ice bunny?! Just then, a car pulls up and a mystery pimp steps out. Tracy says it's The
                Bishop, but he's alone - Timmer must have called him looking for Ariel. This can't be good.<br/><br/>

                The Bishop storms in, yelling for Timmer to explain who Benson and Fin are. When Benson turns around to
                answer, she's shocked to see The Bishop is none other than Declan Murphy, SVU's former chief, now deep
                undercover. When Carisi, who doesn't know who Murphy is, starts mouthing off, The Bishop pistol-whips
                him in
                the head, knocking him down. Suddenly, Benson pulls out her gun, points it at Murphy and tells him to
                drop
                the gun. After a short standoff, the rest of the SVU squad bursts in the door and busts the whole party,
                including Benson, Fin and Carisi.<br/><br/>

                Back at the station, Murphy blows up at Benson and Fin for ruining his undercover mission. Benson
                explains
                to him they're looking for Ariel, but he has bigger priorities, specifically taking down a major
                trafficker,
                Johnny D. He does admit he knows Ariel, but she's damaged goods since Timmer beat her up before selling
                her
                to Johnny D. He doesn't know where Johnny D. keeps his girls and refuses to jeopardize his cover by
                asking
                to buy Ariel from him. It's too late for Ariel - she's too broken.<br/><br/>

                Rollins tries talking to one of the girls, Nina, whom Martha says knows Ariel. Nina is terrified but
                admits
                Martha was supposed to buy her and Ariel until Timmer walked in on Ariel on the phone with her and beat
                her
                till she blacked out. Nina won't say anything else - she doesn't want to end up like Ariel. Martha
                watches
                the interrogation, devastated that she almost got her daughter killed.<br/><br/>

                Rollins and Fin then tackle Timmer, bluffing that they've been onto him for a year, embedding Selena and
                Martha just to get to him. But they're going to release him and The Bishop because they didn't have a
                search
                warrant. That doesn’t mean Timmer's in the clear, though, because both The Bishop and Johnny D. think
                Timmer
                set them up and they'll surely be out for blood. Timmer's a dead man... unless he helps SVU find
                Ariel...<br/><br/>

                SVU and ESU storm a shady converted space, finding a number of half-naked battered women chained to the
                walls, surrounded by syringes and drugs. After pushing through various rooms, they find Johnny D. using
                Ariel as a shield, a piece of glass held to her neck. Benson takes him down and rescues Ariel, who is
                finally reunited with her mother. Back at the station, Murphy congratulates the team for nabbing Johnny
                D.,
                but warns them not to turn their backs on him. He's trafficked girls for 20 years and has never been
                arrested. Rollins asks if, now that Johnny is facing life in prison, Murphy can return to normal life,
                but
                it's not that easy. Johnny D. was the kingpin, and The Bishop is heir apparent.<br/><br/>

                That night, Benson is home reading to Noah when the doorbell rings. It's M.E. Melinda Warner with some
                big
                news - off-the-book news. She ran Johnny D.'s DNA when it went through the system and found a familial
                match
                in an unrelated case. He never needs to know, but Benson does. Johnny D. is Noah's father.
